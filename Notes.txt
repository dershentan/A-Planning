Lab 5.
1) Gotten A* planning down, can be seen using print line for path_trace.
2) Printing to screen the shortest path back from goal to start position.
3) Fixed all bugs, able to find shortest path, accept new goal and robot able to move from current position to the goal.
4) If goal position or path to it is not available, program will quit and need to be rerun. Make sure goal coordinate are correct.
5) May take sometime especially when correcting angle around 0, so tranversing around horizontally in the right direction may take a while.
